Discussion notes
---

Example:
val collection = problem.collections.pickRandom() // List, Array, Vector, etc
val numericType = problem.numericTypes.pickRandom() // Int, Double, etc
val goal = problem.goals.pickRandom() // avg,sum,etc
val question = "Give $collection of type $numericType write a function to compute $goal"
val testCases : Seq[Code => Boolean] = ???
val rules : Seq[Code => Boolean] = ???

Parts:

1 Question Template 
1a string with substs
1b substs drawn from subst set
1c question is randomly generated

2 Rules validator
2a Each question includes zero or more rules such as "Must use trait", "Cannot use foreach", etc
2b Uses Scala reflection to introspect code and test rules
2c Also see https://github.com/lihaoyi/scala-parser

3 Test validation
3a Each question includes one or more test cases to test answer
3b Code will need to be executed somehow (eventually safely in some sort of VM)
3c See this JVM written in Scala: https://github.com/lihaoyi/Metascala
